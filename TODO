- Write a script that makes sure all reels are stored in their correct folders. 
'reels' and 'reels_non_collection'
- Make a cleanup script that removes duplicates because I renamed "yas" collection to "unknown user"
- what happens when I delete reels? do not simply delete that reel from db entry and the video file. 
instead look for the same url that was deleted from 'reels_non_collection' in collection reels. if it exists merge the two so the videodoesnt get downloaded twice
- what happens when I assign a reel to a collection?
- It should never happen but check if something is marked downloaded but file is not present
